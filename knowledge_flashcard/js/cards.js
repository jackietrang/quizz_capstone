      "question": "Consumer Credit ",
      "answer": "Consumer credit is personal debt taken on to purchase goods and services. A credit card is one form of consumer credit. Although any type of personal loan could be labeled consumer credit, the term is more often used to describe unsecured debt that is taken on to buy everyday goods and services."
    },
    {
      "question": "Types of consumer credit",
      "answer": "There are three main types of consumer credit options: non-installment credit, installment credit, and revolving credit."
    },
    {
      "question": "Installment Credit",
      "answer": "Installment credit is used for a specific purpose and is issued at a defined amount for a set period of time. Payments are usually made monthly in equal installments. Installment credit is used for big-ticket purchases such as major appliances, cars, and furniture. Installment credit usually offers lower interest rates than revolving credit as an incentive to the consumer. The item purchased serves as collateral in case the consumer defaults."
    },
    {
      "question": "Revolving Credit",
      "answer": "Revolving credit, which includes credit cards, may be used for any purchase. The credit is 'revolving' in the sense that the line of credit remains open and can be used up to the maximum limit repeatedly, as long as the borrower keeps paying a minimum monthly payment on time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Line of credit",
      "answer": "A line of credit is a flexible loan from a financial institution that consists of a defined amount of money that you can access as needed and repay either immediately or over time. Interest is charged on a line of credit as soon as money is borrowed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Grace period",
      "answer": "The grace period is the gap between the end of your credit card's billing cycle and the date your payment is due. With most credit cards, if you pay your balance in full and have no cash advances outstanding, you won't be charged interest on new purchases you make during this interval."
    },
    {
      "question": "APR",
      "answer": "APR, or Annual Percentage Rate refers to the total cost of your borrowing for a year. Importantly, it includes the standard fees and interest you will have to pay."
    },
    {
      "question": "Credit card principal",
      "answer": "Credit card principal is the amount of money you charge, transfer or advance yourself. For example, if you buy a CD, that goes onto your credit card balance and is part of the principal on which your interest is calculated."
    },
    {
      "question": "Credit Rating",
      "answer": "A credit score, also known as a credit rating, is a three-digit number that reflects how reliable you are when it comes to repaying money. Your credit score is based on how you've handled money in the past. The higher your credit score, the better your chances of being accepted for credit, and at the best rates."
